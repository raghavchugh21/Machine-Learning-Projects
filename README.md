# 100DaysOfMachineLearning
To hold myself accountable I chose to do this with the #100DaysOfMLCode challenge. The principle is that you code for at least an hour each day for 100 continuous days and log your progress.

cd Machine_Learning
git init
git add motivation
git commit -m "100 days straight"
